<h3>Fontmatrix</h3>
<p> A font manager for Linux.</p>
<p><div align="justify">Fontmatrix is aimed at adventurous graphic designers and typesetters who need to manage hundreds and even thousands of fonts for their work - avoiding the need to browse overly long lists in dialogs.</div></p>
<p>Basically, Fontmatrix helps you do three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activating and deactivating your fonts</li>
<li>Tagging fonts with sets</li>
<li>Finding suitable fonts by constructing simple or complex queries</li>
<li>Refining the fonts selection by comparing glyphs in details</li>
<li>Generating font "books" as PDF.</li>
</ul>
