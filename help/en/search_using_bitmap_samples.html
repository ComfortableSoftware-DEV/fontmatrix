<h2>Searching using bitmap samples</h2>

<p>If you have an enormous fonts collection, you can search for a font using a bitmap sample of one of the glyphs. There are two ways to do it: you can either feed Fontmatrix with a ready bitmap file or use <em>Grab</em> mode that will fetch a bitmap image right from your display.</p>

<p>When you have the image in the raster sample preview, click on the glyph for Fontmatrix to compute its bounding box. If Fontmatrix got it wrong, enable the <em>Tweak rect</em> checkbox and drag corners of a frame around presumed bounding box until it's right.</p>

<p>Now type in the character that is on the sample and press <b>Search</b> button.</p>
